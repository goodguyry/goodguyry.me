I am a husband, dog father and Seattle transplant. I can be found cheering on [Sounders FC](http://soundersfc.com), playing my guitar or Googling the current topic of conversation just for the fun of it.

I work at [Story](http://storyworldwide.com/) as a <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>/<abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr> Specialist, part of a close-knit Creative Technology team based in New York.

I love coffee and cannot be trusted around cookies.

Find me online at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) and [GitHub](http://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}).
