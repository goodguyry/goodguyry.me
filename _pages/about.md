I am a husband, dog father and Seattle transplant. I can be found cheering on [Sounders FC](http://soundersfc.com), playing my guitar, [hoarding GIFs](http://jif.io) or Googling the current topic of conversation.

As a <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> Developer at [Alley Interactive](https://alley.co/), I work with an immensely talented team of folks creating solutions for digital publishers.

I love coffee and cannot be trusted around cookies.

Find me online at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ accounts.twitter_username }}) and [GitHub](http://github.com/{{ accounts.github_username }}).
