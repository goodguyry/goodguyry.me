I am a husband, dog father and Seattle transplant. I can be found cheering on [Sounders FC](http://soundersfc.com), playing my guitar, [hoarding GIFs](http://jif.io) or Googling the current topic of conversation.

I love coffee and cannot be trusted around cookies.

I'm currently looking for a Front-End Developer position in a stable, fun organization. Please drop me a line if you know of a text editor in need of a character.

Find me online at [Twitter](http://twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}) and [GitHub](http://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}).
